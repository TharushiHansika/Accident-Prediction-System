# Accident-Prediction-System
Predicting Accidents Before They Happen

# Project Description
This project is a real-time accident prediction and warning system that analyzes dashcam video feeds to detect potential collisions before they occur. Using object detection (YOLOv8), depth estimation (MiDaS), and motion tracking (SORT), the system predicts time-to-collision (TTC) and issues real-time warnings to alert drivers of potential accidents.

-Object detection for vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, and obstacles

-Depth estimation using MiDaS for distance calculation

-Time-to-Collision (TTC) estimation to predict crashes

-Real-time tracking using SORT/DeepSORT

-Dynamic warnings for collision risk, pedestrian crossings, bus stops, etc.

-Visual overlays and audio alerts for driver safety


# Prerequisites
-Python 3.8+

-OpenCV

-PyTorch

-YOLOv8 (ultralytics)

-MiDaS (intel-isl/MiDaS)

-SORT (for object tracking)

-Scikit-learn (for risk modeling)
